  abstract = {We show that the multiplication operation c = a * b * r^-1 in the
	field GF(2k) can be implemented
	
	significantly faster in software than the standard multiplication,
	where r is a special fixed element of the field. This
	
	operation is the finite field analogue of the Montgomery multiplication
	for modular multiplication of integers. We
	
	give the bit-level and word-level algorithms for computing the product,
	perform a thorough performance analysis,
	
	and compare the algorithm to the standard multiplication algorithm
	in GF(2k). The Montgomery multiplication
	
	can be used to obtain fast software implementations of the discrete
	exponentiation operation, and is particularly
	
	suitable for cryptographic applications where k is large.},
